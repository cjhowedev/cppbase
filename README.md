# `cppbase`

> A template to generate cross-platform C++ projects for VSCode using CMake.

## Introduction

`cppbase` allows you to quickly generate cross-platform C++ projects for VSCode.
It generates a CMake project which enables you to build your C++ application or
library directly from VSCode using its CMake extensions. `cppbase` projects are
generated using a python script and Jinja templates.

To use `cppbase`, first use GitHub to create a project using this template.
Then, run the `setup.py` script to run the project generation process.
